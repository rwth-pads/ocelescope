class OCEL:
    """
    High-level wrapper for an OCEL 2.0 event log.

    This class provides a structured access layer over a PM4PY OCEL instance.
    It exposes convenient managers for objects, events, E2O relations, O2O
    relations, and extensions. It also supports reading, writing, and
    filtering OCEL logs.

    Attributes:
        ocel (PM4PYOCEL):
            The underlying PM4PY OCEL object containing the raw OCEL data
            (events, objects, relations).
        meta (OCELMeta):
            Metadata associated with this OCEL instance, including file path,
            unique ID, and any additional user-defined information.
        extensions (ExtensionManager):
            Manages all loaded OCEL extensions and handles exporting of
            extension data.
        objects (ObjectsManager):
            Provides structured access to all object-related information such
            as types, attributes, and object tables.
        events (EventsManager):
            Provides structured access to event-level information such as
            activities, event attributes, and event tables.
        e2o (E2OManager):
            Manages event-to-object relations, including typed relations and
            qualifier-based summaries.
        o2o (O2OManager):
            Manages object-to-object relations, providing typed lookups and
            relation-count summaries.
