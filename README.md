---

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

Use the provided `run.sh` script to start or stop the application in development or production mode:
```./run.sh [dev|prod] [up|down] [--detached]```
or just
```docker compose up --build```

### Import/Export

  - [x] as SQLite
  - [x] as JSON
  - [x] as XML
- [x] Export OCEL
  - [x] as SQLite
  - [x] as JSON
  - [x] as XML
- [ ] Import Resources (Process Models)
  - [ ] Research supported file formats for process models

---

### Session

- [x] Support multiple OCELs per session
- [x] Support extensions for OCELs
  - [x] Quantity State
    - [ ] Add example plugin using the extension (not essential, but needed as proof of concept)
- [x] Add "Session" page:
  - [x] Add, delete, and rename OCELs
  - [x] Add, delete, and rename resources

---

### Filter

- [x] Enable global filtering of OCELs
- [x] Allow filters to be used locally in plugins
- [ ] Implement commonly used filters:
  - [x] By event and object type
  - [x] By relation count
  - [x] By time frame
  - [ ] By attribute values
  - [ ] By start/end events of objects
- [x] Implement reusable filter components
- [ ] Allow saving filters in the session (not essential)
- [ ] Support import/export of filters as JSON (not essential)

---

### Statistics

- [ ] Add plugin for common OCEL statistics:
  - [ ] Visualized as charts

---

### OCELOT

- [ ] Add OCELOT-inspired plugin with OCEL functionality:
  - [x] Object/Event data table
    - [x] Table with object-event relations
    - [x] Sortable columns
    - [ ] Global search across all fields
    - [ ] Attribute-based column filtering (not essential)

---

### Resources

    - [x] Object-Centric Petri Net
    - [x] Object-Centric Directly-Follows Graph
    - [x] Totem

#### Frontend
